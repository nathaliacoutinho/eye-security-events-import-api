# README

Hi, thank you for taking the time to review this code.

To get started, please make sure you have Ruby and Rails installed in your machine.

I recommend you use a version management tool, such as RVM or RBENV for installing Ruby.
If you need more information on how to install and use Rails, please check out the docs: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html

Once you have that installed, you can simply start the server by running the following command:

```
rails server
```

This will start the server on port 3000.

## Notes

- There is a file testing_locally.rb where I was testing everything in the rails console, in case you want to check
- I focused on the enrichment and analytics services and didnt get to the API endpoint part, but what is in that testing file pretty much represents the high level flow of the project

- This is pretty much unfinished, it was more a process of approaching thr problem, and I would love to discuss more in person. So you should probably know that it's not fully working.
